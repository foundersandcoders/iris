description='Update project roadmaps from .gemini/roadmaps.json config'
prompt="""
Process roadmaps defined in @.gemini/roadmaps.json. If arguments are provided, process only the matching roadmap ID; otherwise process all active roadmaps.

## Logic
1. Read the roadmap Markdown file at the configured "path".
2. Move completed tasks (checked boxes `[x]`) from "Open" or "Due" sections to the "Completed Tasks" section.
3. Move tasks that are no longer blocked from "Blocked Tasks" to "Open Tasks".
4. Move completed milestones to the "Completed Milestones" section.
5. If the roadmap structure has changed, update the summary table in the project README.md if applicable.
6. Report a summary of all tasks and milestones moved.

## Rules
1. Maintain the existing header hierarchy and numbering where possible.
2. Ensure the "Completed Tasks" section is created if it does not exist.
3. Do not remove descriptions or metadata associated with moved tasks.
